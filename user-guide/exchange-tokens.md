## How to exchange tokens?

1. Choose the token you hold and the token you want to exchange it for. After you enter the amount, SwapX will automatically calculate the corresponding amount of the other token, then click "Swap".
2. Confirm the details for your swap in the confirmation window, then click "Confirm Swap".
3. The swap requires confirmation from your wallet. Please click “Accept” in the “Request Signature” pop-up window.
4. The pop-up box shows that your swap has been submitted.
5. The swap is completed when the upper right of the page shows "confirmed" after a few seconds.
