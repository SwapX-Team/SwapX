## How to add liquidity?

1. Choose a fund pool and click "Add Liquidity", or choose the liquidity you have already added from Pool ->Your Liquidity and click on “Add”.
2. Choose two tokens you want to add liquidity to (one of them should be USDD), and enter the amount of funds you want to add, then click “Supply”.

Note: When you enter the amount of a token, the platform will calculate the corresponding amount of the other token based on the relative price of the token pair in that pool.

3. Click " Confirm to supply" in the confirmation window

4. Adding liquidity requires confirmation from your wallet. Please click “Accept” in the “Request Signature” pop-up window.
5. The pop-up box shows that your transaction for adding liquidity has been submitted.
6. Liquidity is successfully added when the upper right of the page shows "confirmed" after a few seconds.
