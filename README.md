# SwapX
SwapX is an automated liquidity protocol. The goal is to build a cross-chain decentralized exchange where everyone can build their own trading shops. SwapX enables everyone to create their own exchange.
SwapX firmly believes that the fundamental vitality and prospect of DeFi is that everyone should get rewards from a fair and open financial network. DeFi today is still far from reaching that goal height- it is just a game in a small community with a small number of people.
